# EMI Calculator Using Python

**Introduction:**

Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) is a widely used payment method that allows buyers to pay for products or loans in fixed monthly installments. This method is prevalent for various types of loans, including home loans, car loans, bike loans, and education loans. An EMI Calculator is a valuable tool that helps individuals determine the monthly payment amount along with the interest rate. This project aims to develop an EMI Calculator using Python to assist users in calculating their loan EMIs accurately.

**Problem Statement:**

The goal of this project is to create an EMI Calculator that computes the monthly installment for different types of loans based on the principal amount, interest rate, and loan tenure. Specifically, the calculator will:

(i)   Calculate the EMI for a home loan given the principal amount, interest rate, and loan tenure.
(ii)  Determine the maximum loan amount that can be afforded if the interest rate increases and the monthly EMI is capped at a specific amount.
(iii) Compute the total interest paid year-wise and the cumulative interest paid over the loan tenure.
(iv)  Identify the number of months required to repay at least 50% of the principal amount.

The project will use Python to implement these calculations and provide a user-friendly code for managing loan payments.

**Project Description:**
â€¢	Developed an EMI Calculator using Python Language which calculated the EMI amount using principal amount, Rate of Interest and Tenure.

**Skills:** Python
